Please respond thoroughly (at least two sentences for each question) to
the following three questions.

1. Describe an experience you had this semester where you saw the power of
functions.

    During this last prove assignment, I defined over a dozen functions to help me with my code. It was super helpful to break it down into different steps.
    In addition to the coursework, these last couple weeks I've also been working on the Advent of Code. On one of these projects, I used a recursive function for the first time; for another, I used several lambda functions. It was really cool to see the power and versatility of funcions.

2. In your judgment, what is the value of test functions?

    Test functions are essential when it comes to adding code to large programs â€“ you can't have your new code ruin the program, especially if it's a website that people are still using. Test functions are also helpful on personal projects as a debugging tool.

3. Describe your process for troubleshooting and fixing a program that
has a problem. What is one thing you can do to improve your process?

    The first thing I'll do is review the error message, if any. It references a specific line of code which I can then go back and fix up. Or, if it's a logic error, I'll manually review the code that's giving me the wrong result to check what logic needs to be fixed. If neither of those methods work, I'll set a breakpoint and use the debugger to follow the variables. So far, this process has helped me solve all my errors. Afterwards, I try to create a test function to verify that my functions always return correct results.
